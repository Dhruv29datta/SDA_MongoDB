# Flight Operations Analysis

Flight Delay dataset taken from kaggle: [Flight Operations Analysis]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whisperingkahuna/gunviolence1](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/usdot/flight-delays?ref=hackernoon.com))

## 1. On-Time Flights
### Objective:
To track the number of flights operating on time compared to a specified target.

### Inference:
The gauge chart shows **582 flights were on time** against a target of **1,000 flights**. This indicates a significant gap in punctuality, suggesting delays in the majority of the operations.


---

## 2. Total Flights Operated
### Objective:
To display the total number of flights operated during the analysis period.

### Inference:
The total flights operated are **247,000**. This indicates a high volume of flight operations, which may be contributing to operational challenges like delays or congestion.

## 3. Departure Delay in USA (Map Visualization)
### Objective:
To visualize the intensity of departure delays geographically across the United States.

### Inference:
The heatmap shows areas with higher departure delays concentrated in specific regions, with values peaking at **300 minutes**. Major hubs in the Midwest and East Coast exhibit significant delays, possibly due to higher traffic density or weather-related challenges.

## 4. Top 10 Airlines with the Highest Average Arrival Delays
### Objective:
To identify airlines with the highest average arrival delays.

### Inference:
The airlines **WN (Southwest Airlines)** and **VX (Virgin America)** have average arrival delays of **40.56 minutes** and **41.48 minutes**, respectively. Airlines **US** and **UA** also show substantial delays, highlighting potential inefficiencies in their operations or external factors like weather.

## 5. Top 5 Busiest Destination Airports by Scheduled Departures
### Objective:
To identify the busiest destination airports based on scheduled departures.

### Inference:
The busiest airport is **ATL (Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta)** with nearly **16,000 scheduled departures**, followed by **ORD (Chicago O'Hare)** and **DFW (Dallas/Fort Worth)**. These high departure volumes could lead to air traffic congestion and contribute to delays.

## 6. Comparing Average Departure Delays Across Airlines
### Objective:
To compare the average departure delays across different airlines.

### Inference:
The airline **MO** shows the highest average departure delay of **~26 minutes**, significantly higher than other airlines. Airlines **F9**, **UA**, and **AA** also exhibit substantial delays, indicating operational inefficiencies or potential resource constraints.

## 7. Airline Performance: Average Monthly Departure Delays
### Objective:
To analyze the average monthly departure delays for different airlines.

### Inference:
The chart reveals that **NK (Spirit Airlines)** experiences the highest average delay in certain months (**~24 minutes**), followed by **UA (United Airlines)**. Variations between airlines suggest differences in operational efficiency or demand during specific periods.

## 8. Airline Taxi-Out Durations by Scheduled Departures
### Objective:
To analyze taxi-out durations by scheduled departure times for different airlines.

### Inference:
The chart highlights that airlines with higher scheduled departure times often face prolonged taxi-out durations (peaking at **140 minutes**). This is especially noticeable for **AA (American Airlines)** and **WN (Southwest Airlines)**, indicating potential ground operations inefficiencies.
